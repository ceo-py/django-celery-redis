# django-celery-redis

In a simplified manner, here's how Django, Celery, and Redis work together, along with two examples:

Django: This is your web application's framework, responsible for handling user requests and responses. When a user triggers an action that requires time-consuming or background processing, Django can delegate that task to Celery.

Celery: Celery is a separate service that runs alongside your Django application. It acts as a task queue, receiving requests from Django to execute tasks asynchronously. These tasks can be things like sending emails, processing data, or performing other resource-intensive operations.

Redis: Redis is used as a message broker and task scheduler for Celery. When Django sends a task to Celery, it's placed in a queue within Redis. Celery workers (separate processes) continuously check this queue for tasks to execute. Redis also handles scheduling tasks to run at specific times or intervals.

Examples:

Scheduled Task: Let's say you want to schedule a daily email newsletter to be sent to your subscribers. You can define this task in Django and schedule it with Celery using Redis as the scheduler. Redis will trigger the task at the specified time (e.g., 8 AM every day) without manual intervention. This scheduled task ensures that your newsletter is sent out consistently and reliably.

Normal Shared Task: Imagine a user uploads a large image to your application. To avoid slowing down the user interface, you can delegate the image resizing task to Celery. When the user uploads the image, Django sends the task to Celery via Redis. Celery processes this task in the background, resizing the image and saving it. Once complete, it can send a notification to the user. This asynchronous task ensures that your application remains responsive, and users don't have to wait for the image to be processed before continuing to use the site.

In summary, this combination of Django, Celery, and Redis allows your web application to efficiently handle both scheduled tasks and normal shared tasks. Whether you need to automate daily processes or offload resource-intensive operations, this setup ensures that your application remains responsive and reliable.
